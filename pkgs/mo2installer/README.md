# Mod Organizer 2 Installer
## Current Version 2.5.2

To install a Mod Organizer 2 instance on one of your steam games, run the installer with steam-run
```bash
steam-run mo2installer
```

From here the installation process will be the same as described on the [original installer page](https://github.com/Furglitch/modorganizer2-linux-installer)


Some additional notes:
- Once installed, you can run the target game through steam as normal and it will open in Mod Organizer 2
- After first installing MO2 ensure you select the **Global** instance option. Portable has issues.
